# Home Assistant Sunthalpy Integration
The `Suntahlpy` [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) integration allows you to interact with your [Suntahlpy](https://sunthalpy.com/) installation inside Home Assistant as you would from the [Suntahlpy client webpage](https://cliente.sunthalpy.com/).

This integration also creates some additional helper sensors for energy monitoring. This allows for an easier integration with the default Energy dashbpoard in Home Assistant.

**Note**: This custom component is based on [integration_blueprint template](https://github.com/ludeeus/integration_blueprint). Most of this project content remains as it was in the blueprint.
